# Hololens Aquarium Game
## Joe Jung, Joanna Ho
This is the unity project folder for the Hololens Aquarium Game, developed in Unity 2018.4.9f1 with Windows Mixed Reality Toolkit

This game is inspired by a 2d flash game called insaniquarium. Insaniquarium is a management/strategy type game where the player can feed and buy new fish. As the game progresses, the fish will grow in size and drop rewards for the user to buy more fish or supplies. The game also spawns monster bosses once in awhile, which the player must defeat before it eats the fish.  

### Features 
* immersive underwater environment. Player can walk around in an augmented reality and observe swarming fish, rocks and currents
* player can feed fish with hololens click gesture, and collect coins by focusing gaze
* monster spawning and click gesture combat 
* shop purchase area to buy more fish

### Note
This game is intended for, and has been tested for the Hololens 1

### Usage
Pull project into a new directory and open with Unity 2018.4.9f1. Connect Hololens device and deploy. Enjoy!
